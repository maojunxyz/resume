#     Forecastr is an android app designed to make it easy to view the forecast at your favourite spots. Targeted at
#     sports where the weather is key to a good session forecastr makes it quick to see which spot is best all
#     on one screen. Forecastr includes wind, weather, swell and tide times.

#     Forecastr is an app I have been building as I have a keen interest in
#     <mark>Android</mark> development and wanted a personal project I could use to help build my skills. I chose to build
#     this app as I felt like it's something I would use myself and also something that would set some good challenges
#     across lots of different areas of the build.

#     During the build I have utilised a number of different android libraries such as ActionBarSherlock, Dagger and
#     Otto. As well as these the app also talks to a backend API and uses a SQLite DB.
